# Chess Engine

A fully-featured chess game built in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface. The application supports all core mechanics of chess, including:

- Legal move generation for all standard pieces
- Castling (both kingside and queenside)
- En passant captures
- Checkmate and stalemate detection
- Highlighted move options and interactive piece movement

The game offers two modes:

Player vs. Player: two human players can play locally
Player vs. Computer: includes an AI opponent that evaluates moves and selects the best option within a 5-second time limit
